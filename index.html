        <h1>Zing Refund Policy</h1>

        <p>
            At Zing, we strive to provide seamless access to our platform for shop owners to market their products effectively. 
            By using our services, you agree to the terms of this Refund Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Subscription Payment</h2>
        <p>
            Shop owners are required to make monthly payments to Zing to access the Store Management feature of the app. 
            This payment grants you access to the platform for a period of 30 days from the date of payment.
        </p>

        <h2>Non-Refundable Payments</h2>
        <p>
            All payments made via the PayHere payment gateway are <strong>non-refundable</strong> once access to the Store Management feature is granted. 
            Upon successful payment, shop owners will have full access to their store management for the designated 30-day period.
        </p>
        <p>
            No refunds will be provided in case of cancellation, non-usage, or early termination of service within the subscription period.
        </p>

        <h2>Access Expiration</h2>
        <p>
            If shop owners do not renew their subscription after the 30-day period, access to their store in the app will be automatically disabled 
            until a new payment is made.
        </p>
        <p>
            No refunds will be issued for any period of non-access due to failure to renew the subscription.
        </p>

        <h2>Payment Issues</h2>
        <p>
            If any issues occur during the payment process, such as double billing or technical errors, shop owners are advised to contact Zing Support 
            within 7 days of the transaction to resolve the issue. Refunds will only be issued in the event of technical or billing errors, 
            subject to Zingâ€™s discretion.
        </p>

        <h2>Disputes</h2>
        <p>
            All disputes regarding payments made via PayHere must be resolved directly with Zing Support. In cases where a refund is applicable due 
            to technical errors, the refund will be processed within 7-10 business days after approval.
        </p>

        <p>
            By making a payment, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this Refund Policy.
        </p>
